# ðŸŽ² Chaos Engineering Overview

## What is Chaos Engineering?

Chaos Engineering is a discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. It involves intentionally introducing failures to test system resilience and identify weaknesses before they cause real problems.

## Core Principles

### 1. Build a Hypothesis Around Steady State Behavior
- Define what "normal" looks like for your system
- Establish metrics that indicate healthy operation
- Create baseline measurements for comparison

### 2. Vary Real-World Events
- Simulate realistic failure scenarios
- Test both expected and unexpected failures
- Include infrastructure, application, and network failures

### 3. Run Experiments in Production
- Test in the actual production environment
- Use real traffic and real data
- Ensure experiments don't impact users

### 4. Automate Experiments to Run Continuously
- Make chaos engineering a regular practice
- Automate experiment execution
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines

## Benefits of Chaos Engineering

### 1. Improved Reliability
- **Proactive Problem Detection**: Find issues before they affect users
- **Faster Recovery**: Practice recovery procedures regularly
- **Reduced Downtime**: Identify and fix weak points

### 2. Increased Confidence
- **System Understanding**: Better understanding of system behavior
- **Team Preparedness**: Teams know how to handle failures
- **Documentation**: Clear procedures for common failures

### 3. Better Architecture
- **Resilience Design**: Design systems with failure in mind
- **Dependency Management**: Understand and manage dependencies
- **Resource Planning**: Better capacity planning

## Chaos Engineering in Kubernetes

### Why Kubernetes Needs Chaos Engineering

Kubernetes environments are complex with many moving parts:
- **Multiple Components**: API server, scheduler, controller manager, kubelet
- **Dynamic Nature**: Pods being created, destroyed, and rescheduled
- **Network Complexity**: Service mesh, ingress, load balancers
- **Storage Dependencies**: Persistent volumes, storage classes
- **External Dependencies**: Databases, APIs, third-party services

### Common Failure Scenarios

#### 1. Pod Failures
```yaml
# Pod failure experiment
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: pod-failure-test
spec:
  action: pod-failure
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces: [default]
    labelSelectors:
      app: critical-app
  duration: 30s
  scheduler:
    cron: "@every 10m"
```

#### 2. Node Failures
```yaml
# Node failure experiment
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1

  name: node-failure-test
spec:
  action: node-failure
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces: [default]
  duration: 60s
  scheduler:
    cron: "@every 30m"
```

#### 3. Network Issues
```yaml
# Network delay experiment
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1

  name: network-delay-test
spec:
  action: delay
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces: [default]
  delay:
    latency: 100ms
    correlation: 100
    jitter: 0ms

## Experiment Design

### 1. Experiment Planning

#### Define Objectives
```yaml
experiment_objectives:
  - name: "Test application resilience to pod failures"
    description: "Verify that the application can handle pod crashes gracefully"
    success_criteria:
      - "Application remains available during pod failure"
      - "Failed pods are automatically restarted"
      - "No data loss occurs"
    failure_criteria:
      - "Application becomes unavailable"
      - "Pods fail to restart"
      - "Data corruption occurs"
```

#### Identify Blast Radius
```yaml
blast_radius:
  scope: "single pod in non-critical service"
  impact: "minimal user impact"
  duration: "30 seconds"
  frequency: "once per hour"
  rollback: "automatic after duration"
```

### 2. Experiment Execution

#### Pre-Experiment Checklist
```yaml
pre_experiment_checks:
  - "Verify system is in steady state"
  - "Check all monitoring dashboards are working"
  - "Ensure team is notified of experiment"
  - "Prepare rollback procedures"
  - "Set up alerting for experiment duration"
```

#### During Experiment Monitoring
```yaml
monitoring_metrics:
  - "Application response time"
  - "Error rate"
  - "Pod restart count"
  - "Node resource usage"
  - "Network connectivity"
  - "Database connection pool"
```

### 3. Post-Experiment Analysis

#### Data Collection
```yaml
data_collection:
  metrics:
    - "System performance during experiment"
    - "Recovery time after experiment"
    - "User impact metrics"
    - "Resource utilization"
  logs:
    - "Application logs"
